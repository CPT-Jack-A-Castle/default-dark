True Ocean (Base16) Theme for Brackets
============================

Attempting to be as close to [Ocean](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#ocean) as possible.

Please critique how I have implemented the colors, and offer suggestions as to how I can improve this theme. I would love to improve it in every way I can.

I do not claim credit for the color scheme - this is the work of [Chris Kempson](http://chriskempson.com). I have simply made this color scheme a theme compatible with Brackets.
